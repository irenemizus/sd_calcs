## A script for finding related pairs of calculated and observed states for different molecules and obtaining deviations and sd values for them
        
        By now, the following is supported:
        - molecules: H2-16O, N2O
        - files with calculated data: fort.14-like, ExoMol states-like
        - files with observed data: MARVEL-like 
        - output formats: Yurchenko's fit input file
        - output labeling formats: A/B symmetries (A1, A2, B1, B2), 6 quantum numbers for H2-16O, 4 quantum numbers for N2O
